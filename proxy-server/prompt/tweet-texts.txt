Why don‚Äôt they teach web dev in college? Is it too easy? Changing too much?

I‚Äôm in my 4th year and literally all of the js I‚Äôve learned has had to be self taught. Like yeah I made a multithreaded volume renderer in C for a class project, but why don‚Äôt they teach how to ship it?
Should I learn tailwind fr? Or should I just keep grinding pure css
